                                         my parent's plants. Why I love to do it because I felt when I give 
                                         all the plants water, It's like I brings a life for them. As you know,
                                          we and plant are the same because we need water to live a life. 
                                          If you wants to know, this sunflower is my favourite one because I plant it.
                                           hehe, but now when all the flowers already blooms, and I cut the heavy 
                                           one then all the beautiful is gone. It's okay, at least I already have it.</p>
